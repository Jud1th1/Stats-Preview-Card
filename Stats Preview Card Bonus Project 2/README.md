## Overview
Created a Stats Preview Card webpage using the style guide provided. Mobile and Desktop designs were given and replicated as closely as possible.  


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- Webpage should be responsive for desktop and mobile devices

## My process

I started this design by working on the mobile design first. I removed the internal stylesheet to create an external one and then finalized the html page by adding my relevant tags and classes according to how they would layout on the completed webpage. I found using a CSS reset helps with these projects to reduce browser inconsistencies so I added Josh Comeau's reset to my stylesheet. Afterwards I added my root elements that I would frequently use in my stylesheet according to the stylesheet provided (my fonts and colors). Once I finished my "css prep" I worked on everything that would appear to the left column of my page (the text) by adding Google fonts and adjusting padding, margins, and colors. The image took the longest to complete due to my inexperience with the color overlay. Once the mobile design was done and I was happy with the end result I then added the necesary display changes for the desktop view. So I changed the order of my image and the text, increased font sizes, and then adjusted some margins and paddings. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Josh Comeau's CSS reset https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/

### What I learned

As my second mobile first workflow project, I found it a little challenging to properly adjust my desktop view to reflect the image to the right of the page beacuse it would default to the left first. I did figure it out in the end.


### Continued development

Areas I could continue working on: 

- Flex-box properties (just a little more practice can be helpful)
- Image overlays
- mobile to desktop design
